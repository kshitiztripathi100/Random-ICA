# Random-ICA
Independent Component Analysis
A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate
data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation
of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear
transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA)
is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically
independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications,
including feature extraction and signal separation
